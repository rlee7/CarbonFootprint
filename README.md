Carbon Karma (or Carbon Footprint) is a business to business web application inspired by Credit Karma, a credit optimization platform. Carbon Karma is designed to optimize the CO2 emission of our users by allowing them to take a quiz based on their lifestyle, and recommending company, brand, and lifestyle changes based on the user's answers to help improve their CO2 emissions.
